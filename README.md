EFI file for Acer Nitro V 16 with Ryzen 7 8845HS

**WHAT WORKS**
It boots most of the times. If it gets stuck, restart your laptop and try again, it will unstuck on it's own. From what I understand it hangs because of a USB issue.
Ethernet

**WHAT DOESN'T WORK**
Graphic Acceleration
Wi-Fi & Bluetooth

I did not test it much, I uploaded this EFI file in case someone needs a "template" for this laptop to be able to improve on it.

Do not expect further updates to this.
